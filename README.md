# Qryo

Playing around with offline-first queries with tanstack/query, Nuxt and Directus.

## Running example

Open this project in gitpod. If the main terminal doesn't run `make start` automatically, do it yourself.
The Nuxt Example, Directus Instance and Vitepress for the docs will start. Making changes to `packages/qryo`
will be updated and should be reflected in the Nuxt example.

See which scripts are running with `pm2 ps`. Get the build logs for the packages by running `pm2 logs packages`
or run `make logs`.

Run `make help` for all available commands.
