# Qryo

This is the core package to handle CRUD requests and pipe them to tanstack/query.

Additionally, to it's excellent qualities as a wordplay on disconnected brains in vats â€“ Qryo is of course an acronym:
* Quickly Retrieve Your Objects
* Qryo Resurrects Your Output
* Query & Request, Yet Offline

... and potentially many more you could dream of while floating in a life-sustaining liquid.
